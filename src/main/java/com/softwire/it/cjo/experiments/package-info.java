 * This package contains some code pulled from an old project that tried to implement monitors using semaphores.
 * It is included largely just for my own interest right now, but I might move it around as a proof of the power of channels.<br>
 * It is likely possible to implement binary semaphores with channels, but implementing monitors directly "might" be harder,
 * so having this step is useful. I may then use monitors to implement Conditional Vars in POSIX threads, etc...<br>
 * <br>
 * So this package isn't really part of the project - just an old piece of code I intend to look at later and wanted to keep nearby
 * for myself.
